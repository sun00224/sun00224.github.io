            Hi, I am Botao. I am from China. I love traveling. I love North America, and I like many cities, such as Vancouver, Toronto, New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Miami. In the future, I want to travel around the world. I also really like cars, especially American muscle cars. I love the Mustang and the Dodge Challenger. My favorite car is the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado convertible. I also like fashion, My favorite brands are Supreme, Off-White, and CLOT. There are so many things I like about this world and I love this world. My favorite quote is <blockquote>Better late than never.-<cite>Geoffrey Chaucer</cite></blockquote>

            Now, I am a student studying IMD course at Algonquin College because I like design and photography. I hope to find a job related to design and photography after I graduate, which is why I chose the IMD program. Previously, I thought coding was boring, but after three weeks of web development classes, I discovered coding is very interesting. Also, Rob is a nice teacher who is very patient and supportive. I will try my best in the web development course.
